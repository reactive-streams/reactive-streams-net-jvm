# reactive-streams-net-jvm

This is a nascent project exploring the definition of Reactive Stream Java APIs for network protocols such as TCP, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, WebSockets, UDP, and [Reactive Streams IO](https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-io).

Exploration of this along with goals and motivations can be found in https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-net-jvm/issues/1
